# Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains my solutions to the
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles in 2024.

This year, I'm using this as an opportunity to get better a problem solving in
[Go](https://go.dev/). Will try to structure the whole project in a way that is
easy to navigate and understand.

The solutions are in the `./days` directory. Each day has its own directory, and
there is a solution for each part of the puzzle. The input directory contains
the puzzle input for each day.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on
how to deploy the project on a live system.

## MakeFile

Run build make command with tests

```bash
make all
```

Build the application

```bash
make build
```

Run the application

```bash
make run
```

Live reload the application:

```bash
make watch
```

Run the test suite:

```bash
make test
```

Clean up binary from the last build:

```bash
make clean
```
